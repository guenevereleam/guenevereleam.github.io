            <h2>Person climbing</h2>
            <p>I may add a section about my hobbies (I partially already have on the resume page), and climbing is one of those so includng a climbing photo on that page would be fitting.</p>

            <h2>Space (Cepheus A)</h2>
            <p>I was previously an astronomy major and still am very interested in the topic. This is a new photo of a high-mass star-forming region from the Hubble space telescope which is cool and would be cool to add to a page discussing my background/story when I mention my previous majors.</p>

            <h2>My Cats</h2>
            <p>My cats Esme (the black one) and Susie (the siamese/tabby mix) are one of the best parts of my life and would deserve a whole page dedicated to them. In fact, I may just add a photo of them to the bottom of every page regardless of if it's relevant. Cats are always relevant.</p>
