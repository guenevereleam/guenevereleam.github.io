            <h2>In Short...</h2>
            <p> Data scientist at UMass Amherst with an interest in technical and professional writing. </p>
            
            <h2>More Details...</h2>
            <p>I am a Senior at UMass graduating with the class of 2026. 
                At UMass, I study Informatics to become a data scientist, and I am minoring in English to be able to adeptly communicate tehcnical concepts in an understandable way.</p>
            <p>I also work at UMass Amherst's central IT help desk as a consultant. 
                This is my fourth year working at UMass IT, and I have been Student Team Lead there for about a year.</p>
            <p>I live in Downtown Amherst in a small apartment with my partner and two cats. 
                In my free time, I like to read, play video games, create art, and rock climb. 
                After I graduate, I am looking forward to moving back to Boston where I grew up, where I am hoping to be able to find a job working in data science, data communications, or IT.</p>
